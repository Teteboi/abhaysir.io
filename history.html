 Ever since from early bicycles, scientist searched the way to make transport on public roads more automated and faster. 
 <br>With that goal in mind, in last one and a half century many inventors tried to make their version of the motorcycle.</br> 
 Here are some most important events regarding their discoveries:
</p>
<ol>
<li style="color:red"><b>1867-</b><p>First steam-powered motorcycle was made during 1867, in the factory of famous bicycle inventor Pierre Michaux.
 <br>His son Ernest who also invented the bicycle pedals attached small steam engine to one of his bicycle designs.</br></p></li>
 <li style="color:red"><b>1868-</b><p>American, Sylvester H. Roper presented his twin cylinder steam velocipede with a coal burn furnace. 
 <br>He died in 1896 while performing a demonstration of one of his steam motorcycles.</br></p></li>
 <li style="color:red"><b>1871-</b><p>French engineer Louis-Guillaume Perreaux developed steam one cylinder motorcycle with an alcohol burner.
 </p></li>
 <li style="color:red"><b>1881–</b><p>American inventor Lucius Copeland strapped small boiler engine on a rear wheel of “farthing-penny” bicycle.

 <li style="color:red"><b>1894 –</b><p>“Hildebrand & Wolfmüller” was the first mass-produced motorcycle in the world. Sadly, only several hundred units were produced.
 <br>After that year, many more motorcycle makers started building their designs around the world.</br></p></li>
 <li style="color:red"><b>1895 –</b><p>First motorcycle came to USA via the French circus group. 
 <br>In the same year, American inventor E.J. Pennington demonstrated his first version of motorcycle that had top speed of 58mph.</br></p></li>
 <li style="color:red"><b>1900 –</b><p>Werner Brothers submitted first motorcycle patent.</p></li>
 <li style="color:red"><b>1901-1903 –</b><p>Several big manufacturing plants started their production of motorcycles, <br>most notably English Royal Enfield, Triumph, American Harley-Davidson and Indian Motorcycle Manufacturing Company.</br>
 During that time begun the first organized motorcycle races, which in return increased demand for faster and powerful engines and designs.</p></li>
 <li style="color:red"><b>1928 –</b><p>German company DKW managed to become largest motorcycle maker in the world, surpassing American builders Indian and Harley-Davidson.</p></li>
 <li style="color:red"><b>Present day</b><p>Today beside Japanese companies several other manufacturers hold sizable piece of the market.
